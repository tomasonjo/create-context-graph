# Changelog

## v0.11.3 — Streaming for CrewAI/Strands + NAMS hardening (2026-05-19)

Rolls up streaming chat for the last two non-streaming frameworks, a much better NAMS failure-mode UX (classified errors surfaced in `/health`, memory-backend auto-detection from `.env`), lighter NAMS dependencies, custom-domain robustness fixes, and silent-failure cleanup across all 8 agent templates.

### New Features

- **Streaming chat for CrewAI and Strands.** Both frameworks now implement `handle_message_stream()`, so the `/chat/stream` SSE endpoint streams text deltas as the model produces them — previously these two frameworks emitted tool events live but text only arrived at the end of the run. CrewAI subscribes to `LLMStreamChunkEvent` on the crew event bus; Strands iterates `agent.stream_async()`. Both include a 60s timeout, partial-text fallback assembly, and emit `entities_extracted` / `preferences_detected` events. This closes out the streaming matrix — all 8 frameworks now stream text.
- **`--import-preview` CLI flag.** Parses a chat export file (`--import-file …` + `--import-type …`) and prints a sanity-check summary (entity counts, conversation date range, sample titles) without scaffolding or ingesting. Useful before committing to a long import of a 1 GB+ ChatGPT/Claude AI export. Implemented in `cli.py::_run_import_preview()`.
- **NAMS error classification surfaced in `/health`.** New `_classify_memory_error()` in `memory.py.j2` buckets NAMS init failures into `auth` / `rate_limit` / `network` / `config` / `unknown`, with human-readable messages mapped per category (e.g. "NAMS authentication failed — verify MEMORY_API_KEY at https://memory.neo4jlabs.com"). The `/health` endpoint now returns `nams_error`, `nams_error_message`, `nams_error_detail`, and `nams_dashboard` so the frontend can show a useful diagnostic instead of a generic "memory unavailable". Exposed via `get_error_category()` / `get_error_message()` / `get_error_detail()` for the FastAPI startup banner.
- **Memory-backend auto-detection from `.env`.** New `@model_validator` in `config.py.j2` reconciles `memory_backend` with the credentials actually present in `.env`: flips `nams → bolt` if `MEMORY_API_KEY` is blank but `NEO4J_URI` is set (and vice-versa), printing a warning. An explicit `MEMORY_BACKEND` env var still wins. Default Neo4j credentials in generated `.env` are now empty rather than baked-in placeholder passwords.
- **Lighter NAMS dependency footprint.** Generated `pyproject.toml` for NAMS scaffolds drops the `sentence-transformers` extra (NAMS does embeddings server-side) — extras shrink from `[litellm,sentence-transformers]` to `[litellm]`. `_resolve_embedding_model()` short-circuits to `None` on NAMS so the generated venv no longer pulls `torch` for a backend that doesn't use local embeddings.

### Bug Fixes

- **Custom-domain renderer crash.** `_get_domains_path()` was imported inside a narrow `try:` scope in `renderer.py`, raising `UnboundLocalError` in the success path after partially writing `ontology.yaml`. Import hoisted to module scope.
- **Custom-domain generation produced silently-truncated ontologies.** `custom_domain.py` now checks the LLM response `stop_reason` for truncation, validates with Pydantic, and asserts completeness (non-empty `system_prompt` / `visualization` / `agent_tools`) before accepting. Provides actionable retry messages and clearer errors when the Anthropic/OpenAI SDK isn't installed.
- **Agent-template degradations across all 8 frameworks.** Jinja conditionals that checked `param.default` truthiness were rewritten to `param.default is defined`, and a silent fallback that swallowed Jinja syntax errors was removed so render failures now surface instead of degrading to stub code. Affects every framework template (`anthropic_tools`, `claude_agent_sdk`, `crewai`, `google_adk`, `langgraph`, `openai_agents`, `pydanticai`, `strands`).
- **Partial streamed text discarded on agent errors.** Strands and CrewAI now accumulate emitted text deltas and return the partial response when a generator raises mid-stream, instead of throwing away accumulated output. Also drops a redundant `RuntimeError` branch from the memory error classifier.
- **NAMS Docker builds crashed on `spacy download`.** The v0.11.2 fix for the generated `Makefile` is now mirrored in `Dockerfile.backend.j2` via `{% if not is_nams %}` — NAMS images no longer fail at build time on a download command for a package they don't depend on.
- **Frontend "Ask about" button rendered on non-string entity names.** `ContextGraphView.tsx.j2` adds a `typeof === "string"` guard before reading `.properties.name`.
- **E2E selector regex out of date.** `e2e/app.spec.ts.j2` regexes updated from `/try a demo scenario/i` to `/try these/i` to match the current welcome card label.

### Documentation

- **`docs/docs/how-to/use-nams.md` — new "Seeding a relationship-rich graph" section.** Documents NAMS's current lack of `add_relationship` REST support and shows two working patterns: (Option A) scaffold with `--self-hosted --demo` for the rich dev experience, flip `MEMORY_BACKEND=nams` for production reads; (Option B) seed bolt first then migrate. Includes a `TODO(nams-relationships)` pointer for the future server-side API.
- **Generated README (`base/README.md.j2`)** — minor wording updates for the NAMS sign-up flow and the `--import-preview` workflow.

### Internal / CI

- **CodeQL `py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization` cleanup.** Test assertions in `test_nams_adapter.py` switched from URL substring checks (`"memory.neo4jlabs.com" in env`) to full-URL or content-phrase matches.
- **Frontend devDeps pinned (`package.json.j2`).** Added `@types/react-dom ^19.0.0`; `overrides` section pins `lodash ^4.17.24` and `postcss ^8.5.10` to dodge known vulnerable transitive versions.
- **New test coverage:** ~600 new test lines spread across `test_nams_adapter.py` (NAMS error classification, backend auto-detection, Dockerfile spacy guard), `test_renderer.py` (template-degradation guards, custom-domain regression), `test_custom_domain.py` (truncation/completeness validation), `test_generated_project.py` (CrewAI/Strands streaming surface), `test_chat_import.py` (`--import-preview`), `test_cli.py`, `test_doc_snippets.py`, and `test_routes_integration.py`.

## v0.11.2 — Post-release stabilization + pre-release smoke-render target (2026-05-19)

Rolls up three follow-up fixes surfaced by running v0.11.0/v0.11.1 end-to-end on a fresh machine, plus a durable safeguard against the same class of bugs.

### Bug Fixes

- **Full matrix + performance test suites broken on CI.** `test_matrix.py` (184 combos) and `test_performance.py` (23 domains) defined their own local `runner = CliRunner()` fixtures that bypassed the auto-`--self-hosted` shim added to `test_cli.py` in v0.11.0. With NAMS as the new default, every matrix/perf invocation hit the "NAMS API key required for non-interactive mode" guard and failed. 207 of 1,398 slow-suite tests failed on the v0.11.1 tag. **Fix:** moved `_AutoSelfHostedRunner` and the `runner` / `nams_runner` fixtures to `tests/conftest.py` so every test file inherits the auto-self-hosted behavior. Removed the now-duplicate fixtures from `test_cli.py`, `test_matrix.py`, and `test_performance.py`.

- **`make install` and Docker builds crashed on NAMS scaffolds** with `No module named spacy`. Both the generated `Makefile`'s `install-backend` target and the generated `Dockerfile.backend` ran `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` unconditionally, but spacy is only present in the `[extraction]` extra which NAMS scaffolds correctly omit (entity extraction happens server-side on NAMS). **Fix:** wrapped the `spacy download` line with `{% if not is_nams %}` in both `Makefile.j2` and `Dockerfile.backend.j2`. On bolt scaffolds the Makefile path is additionally guarded by an `import spacy` check so it stays robust even if the user uninstalls the extraction extras post-scaffold. Four regression tests in `test_nams_adapter.py::TestBoltRenderedTemplates`: `test_makefile_skips_spacy_download_on_nams`, `test_makefile_guards_spacy_download_on_bolt`, `test_dockerfile_skips_spacy_download_on_nams`, `test_dockerfile_includes_spacy_download_on_bolt`.

- **`make test` in generated projects crashed** with `No module named pytest`. The generated `pyproject.toml` didn't declare pytest or httpx anywhere, so `uv sync` never installed them — the generated `tests/test_routes.py` scaffold couldn't run. **Fix:** added `[project.optional-dependencies] dev = ["pytest>=8.0", "httpx>=0.27"]` to `pyproject.toml.j2`, and changed the generated Makefile's `install-backend` target from `uv sync` → `uv sync --extra dev`. Generated projects can now run `make test` out of the box.

### New Tooling

- **Root `make smoke-render` target** — full scaffold → install → import-check → run-generated-tests sweep for both backends, in `<1 min`, no Neo4j / NAMS / LLM keys required. Catches the class of breakage the mocked unit suite can't see:
  - dep-resolution failures (`uv sync` conflicts)
  - install-time crashes (e.g. spacy download on NAMS)
  - import-time failures in generated `app.main` (e.g. questionary default validation, framework SDKs that validate API keys at module-load time)
  - generated test-scaffold regressions
- Sub-targets `make smoke-render-nams` and `make smoke-render-bolt` for per-backend runs. `make smoke-render-clean` removes the scratch directory (`/tmp/ccg-smoke-render` by default).
- Verified passing locally:
  - NAMS: render → install (no spacy) → import-check → 2 generated tests pass
  - Bolt: render → install (with guarded spacy download) → import-check → 2 generated tests pass

### Process Note

The three issues bundled here all surfaced from running the actual product end-to-end on a fresh machine after the v0.11.0/v0.11.1 tags. Each was a class of issue the mocked unit suite couldn't catch by design (CLI fixture bypass, install-time shell commands, generated-project deps). `make smoke-render` is the durable answer — run it before tagging future releases.

## v0.11.1 — Wizard framework-prompt fix (2026-05-19)

### Bug Fixes

- **Interactive wizard crashed at the framework prompt** with `ValueError: Invalid 'default' value passed. The value ('Strands') does not exist in the set of choices.` — `questionary.select(default=...)` validates the default against `Choice.title`, not `Choice.value`. The wizard was passing the display label (`"Strands"`) but choices used the framework key (`"strands"`) as their value. Fixed by removing the `default=` argument entirely and reordering the choices list so `DEFAULT_FRAMEWORK` is first (questionary highlights the first row on entry). Regression test `TestQuestionaryConstruction` added to `tests/test_wizard.py` — exercises the real `questionary.select` constructor (only `.ask` is stubbed) so any bad `default=` argument fails at construction time. Total test count: 1,177 → 1,179.

## v0.11.0 — NAMS by Default + LiteLLM Provider Injection (2026-05-19)

### Breaking Changes

- **Default memory backend flipped from self-hosted Neo4j to NAMS** — `create-context-graph my-app` now scaffolds against the hosted [Neo4j Agent Memory Service](https://memory.neo4jlabs.com) by default. The wizard collects a NAMS API key as its memory step. Use `--self-hosted` (or any explicit `--neo4j-*` flag) to opt into the legacy bolt path. Existing scaffolded projects are unaffected; only newly generated projects pick up the new default.
- **Generated `pyproject.toml` pins `neo4j-agent-memory>=0.4.0,<0.6.0`** (was `>=0.1.0`). Extras conditional on backend: NAMS scaffolds get `[litellm,sentence-transformers]`; self-hosted scaffolds additionally get `[extraction,fuzzy]` for local entity extraction.
- **`ingest_data()` library signature changed** — now takes a `ProjectConfig` instead of separate Neo4j credentials. CLI users see no change; programmatic users of the `create_context_graph` package must update callers.
- **`MEMORY_API_KEY` env var added** to generated `.env` files. When set, the library auto-routes to NAMS even if `MEMORY_BACKEND` is unspecified.

### New Features

- **NAMS hosted backend support** — Generated `app/memory.py` now constructs `MemoryClient(MemorySettings(backend="nams", nams=NamsConfig(api_key=...)))` on the NAMS path. Sign-up panel printed in the wizard with the `https://memory.neo4jlabs.com` landing URL.
- **`--self-hosted` CLI flag** — Preserves the legacy bolt-Neo4j path with full demo fixtures, schema DDL, and relationship-rich graph view. Recommended for workshops, screen recordings, demos, and air-gapped use.
- **LiteLLM provider injection** — Generated memory layer reads `MEMORY_LLM` and `MEMORY_EMBEDDING` env vars (LiteLLM-style provider strings, e.g. `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5`, `bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`, `vertex_ai/gemini-1.5-flash`, `ollama/llama3`). Native adapters resolve first (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Vertex AI, SentenceTransformers); everything else routes through LiteLLM. Default fallback: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for embeddings, `anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (or `openai/gpt-4o-mini`) for entity extraction.
- **Streamlined 6-prompt wizard** — Collapsed from 11 prompts. Domain picker switched to `questionary.autocomplete`. Inline Anthropic-key prompt removed (deferred to post-scaffold `.env` editing with a prominent reminder panel). Advanced settings (MCP toggle, extraction toggles, extra API keys) gated behind a single Y/N prompt. Median wizard run is now ~6 prompts vs ~11.
- **Default agent framework: AWS Strands** — was previously unselected; the wizard now suggests `strands` as the default. All 8 frameworks remain supported.
- **Backend-aware route adapters** — Generated `app/routes.py` dispatches `/expand`, `/documents`, `/traces`, `/schema/visualization`, `/entities/{name}`, `/search`, `/cypher` to the NAMS REST adapter (`app/memory_adapter.py`) or bolt Cypher path based on `MEMORY_BACKEND`. `/gds/*` returns 501 on NAMS.
- **Backend-aware MCP config** — `claude_desktop_config.json` ships in NAMS or bolt shape depending on the scaffold. NAMS forces `mcp_profile=core` because extended-profile tools rely on unsupported endpoints (preferences/facts).
- **Backend-aware `make reset`** — On NAMS, enumerates entities via REST and deletes one-by-one (slow but correct, with a printed warning). On bolt, retains today's `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`.
- **NAMS-aware `make seed`** — Generated `generate_data.py` branches on `settings.memory_backend`. On NAMS, delegates to `memory_adapter.ingest_fixtures_nams()` which does the B-partial port (see below). On bolt, applies schema + ingests via Cypher.
- **Health endpoint backend-aware** — `/health` returns `{"memory_backend": "nams", "nams": <bool>}` on NAMS or `{"memory_backend": "bolt", "neo4j": <bool>}` on self-hosted.

### NAMS Write-Path Caveats (v0.4)

The NAMS REST API exposes a narrower write surface than bolt Cypher. The CLI does **best-effort B-partial ingest** with these documented gaps:

- **Relationships are dropped on NAMS** — `add_relationship` is not yet exposed by NAMS REST. The CLI logs a single warning per ingest run. The graph view shows entities but no edges.
- **Entity properties collapse into `description`** — NAMS REST accepts only `{name, type, description}` per entity. All other properties (status, severity, blood_type, etc.) are serialized into a markdown block inside `description`. The frontend property panel renders this markdown so the data remains readable.
- **Preferences and facts are unsupported** — `auto_preferences=True` is forced off on NAMS via `ProjectConfig.effective_auto_preferences`. `auto_extract=True` still runs but extracted relationships are silently dropped.
- **Schema DDL skipped on NAMS** — NAMS owns its schema. `CREATE CONSTRAINT`/`CREATE INDEX` statements from `generate_cypher_schema()` are no-ops on the NAMS path.

For the full relationship-rich demo experience, scaffold with `--self-hosted --demo`.

### New CLI Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--self-hosted` | Use self-hosted Neo4j instead of NAMS (the v0.10 default behavior) |
| `--nams-api-key` | NAMS API key (also reads `MEMORY_API_KEY` env) |
| `--nams-endpoint` | Override NAMS endpoint URL (defaults to `https://memory.neo4jlabs.com/v1`) |
| `--memory-llm` | LiteLLM provider string for memory entity extraction |
| `--memory-embedding` | LiteLLM provider string for memory embeddings |

### New Docs Pages

- [Use NAMS](docs/docs/how-to/use-nams.md) — sign-up, API key, switching between NAMS and self-hosted, troubleshooting
- [Configure Memory Providers](docs/docs/how-to/configure-memory-providers.md) — LiteLLM provider strings, native adapters, default fallback behavior, per-provider auth examples
- [Memory Backends](docs/docs/explanation/memory-backends.md) — conceptual NAMS vs self-hosted comparison, choosing per-project, frontend dispatch architecture

### Tests

- **1,177 passing fast tests** (was 1,102 in v0.10). 50 new tests across 4 files:
  - `test_ingest_nams.py` (15) — `_ingest_with_nams` dispatch, entity serialization, document/trace ingestion, relationship-skip warning, missing-API-key error path, `reset_memory_store` for both backends.
  - `test_wizard.py` (7) — drives the interactive wizard via patched questionary; covers NAMS happy path, NAMS+advanced, self-hosted Docker, self-hosted existing-Neo4j, and edge cases.
  - `test_memory_adapter.py` (18) — renders a project, imports the generated `memory_adapter.py` via `importlib`, exercises every adapter function with `AsyncMock` MemoryClient.
  - `test_routes_integration.py` (10, gated by `pytest.importorskip("fastapi")`) — renders a NAMS or bolt project, mounts the generated FastAPI app via `TestClient`, asserts correct dispatch on `/health`, `/documents`, `/search`, `/schema/visualization`, `/expand`, `/traces`, `/gds/*`.
  - `test_nams_adapter.py` extended with 5 runtime dispatch tests.
- **`scripts/e2e_smoke_test.py`** — added `--backend {bolt,nams}` flag. `bolt` default preserves existing flow; `nams` exercises the hosted-memory scaffold path (requires `MEMORY_API_KEY` env).
- **`[dev]` extras** — now include `fastapi`, `httpx`, `pydantic-settings` so route integration tests run in CI.

### Implementation Notes

- **`MemorySettings` / `MemoryClient` / `MemoryIntegration` construction split** in `memory.py.j2` — explicit `MemoryClient(settings)` then `MemoryIntegration(client=client, ...)` (instead of having `MemoryIntegration` build the client implicitly). Enables NAMS backend + LiteLLM provider injection in one place.
- **CodeQL false-positive fix** — `test_nams_adapter.py` assertion changed from substring host check (`"memory.neo4jlabs.com" in env_example`) to full URL match (`"https://memory.neo4jlabs.com/v1" in env_example`) to satisfy `py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`.
- **Generated test scaffold** (`backend/tests/test_routes.py`) — fixture patches both bolt and NAMS connect/close paths so the generated test suite works regardless of backend.

## v0.10.0 — Local-File Document Connector (2026-05-18)

### New Connector
- **local-file connector** — Deterministic ingestion of local Markdown, PDF, HTML, AsciiDoc, and Word documents into `:Document` → `:Section` hierarchies, with `LINKS_TO` edges between sections and documents. No LLMs, no embeddings, no randomness. URI-keyed nodes integrate with the existing MERGE-on-`(name, domain)` pipeline without changes to `ingest.py`. Section URIs use GitHub/Pandoc slug rules (NFKD-normalize, ASCII-lower, `[a-z0-9_]` runs collapse to `-`); duplicate-heading collisions disambiguate per-parent (`-1`, `-2`, …); skipped heading levels (e.g. H1 → H3) preserve the original level on the child node rather than synthesizing intermediate H2s. Parser strategy per format: markdown-it-py with GFM extensions (Markdown); three-tier fallback pypdf outline → `/StructTreeRoot` → pdfplumber font-size heuristic (PDF); BeautifulSoup + lxml (HTML); pure-Python regex with block-delimiter state tracking (AsciiDoc); python-docx (Word). Adds 8 optional dependencies to the `connectors` extra: `markdown-it-py`, `mdit-py-plugins`, `pdf-oxide`, `pypdf`, `pdfplumber`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`, `python-docx`. Implementation in `connectors/local_file_connector.py` and `connectors/_local_file/` subpackage (parser, mapper, slug, link-resolver). 1,721-line `test_local_file_connector.py` plus `test_local_file_vault.py` functional test (`make test-functional`) round-trips a 14-file fixture vault.

### Bug Fixes
- **`reset_database()` connection lifecycle** — Generated `context_graph_client.py` previously assumed a driver was already open. It now opens its own driver when `_driver` is `None` and closes it via `try/finally`, preserving any pre-existing connection. `TestResetDatabase` regression coverage added in `tests/test_generated_project.py`.

### Tests
- 1,102 passing fast tests (1,321 collected including slow/integration/functional).

## v0.9.5 — Options Intelligence Domain & GitHub Connector Enhancements (2026-04-29)

### New Domain
- **options-intelligence** (23rd domain) — Options market intelligence covering 0DTE analysis, dealer positioning (GEX/DEX/VEX/CHEX), gamma regime classification, key levels, and trading strategies. 8 entity types (Underlying, OptionsContract, ExposureLevel, Regime, KeyLevel, Trade, MarketEvent, Strategy), 17 relationships (HAS_OPTION, EXPOSURE_AT, IN_REGIME, TRIGGERED_BY, FLIPPED_TO, PRECEDED_BY, etc.), 10 agent tools (`get_regime`, `get_key_levels`, `get_exposure_by_strike`, `get_trades_by_strategy`, etc.), 5 document templates (market briefs, trade journals, regime analysis), 9 decision traces (trade entry, regime flip, level breach, VIX spike, etc.), 4 demo scenarios. Pre-generated fixture: 65 entities, 125 relationships, 25 documents. 17 new property clamp ranges in `generator.py` for options-specific values (delta `[-1, 1]`, gamma `[0, 0.15]`, IV `[0.05, 2.0]`, strike, GEX, etc.). 8 label-specific name pools and ID prefixes added in `name_pools.py`. Tickers (SPX, SPY, QQQ, IWM, AAPL) added to the global `_TICKER_POOL`.

### GitHub Connector Enhancements
- **Configurable per-resource limits** — `GITHUB_LIMIT=20` sets the default cap for issues, PRs, and commits. Override individually with `GITHUB_ISSUES_LIMIT`, `GITHUB_PRS_LIMIT`, `GITHUB_COMMITS_LIMIT`. Pagination now uses `itertools.islice` to stream results instead of materializing full pages.
- **Issue/PR body import toggle** — `GITHUB_IMPORT_BODY=true` (default) controls whether issue and PR bodies are imported as `Document` nodes. Issue/PR bodies are now labeled "Body" rather than "Document" to better reflect their source.
- **Cross-link issues, PRs, and commits** — `GITHUB_LINK_ISSUES_PRS=true` (default) creates `CLOSES` and `REFERENCES` edges between commits, issues, and PRs. Regex matches `(close|closes|closed|fix|fixes|fixed|resolve|resolves|resolved) #N` → `CLOSES`; bare `#N` → `REFERENCES`. GraphQL `closingIssuesReferences` provides authoritative PR closures. `GITHUB_LINK_SOURCE=both` selects `regex` / `graphql` / `both` (falls back to `both` on invalid values). `CLOSES` takes precedence over `REFERENCES` for the same pair, regex and GraphQL results are deduped, and references to numbers outside the fetched set are silently skipped. GraphQL failures log a warning and return empty rather than hard-failing.

### Bug Fixes
- **Connector relationship field names** — All 7 connectors (GitHub, Notion, Jira, Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, Salesforce) now emit `source_name`/`target_name` in relationship dicts (was `source`/`target`), aligning with the ingest schema.
- **Generated `config.py` Settings fields** — Added env-var fields for all 7 connectors (GitHub, Notion, Jira, Slack, Salesforce, Linear, etc.) so credentials and toggles are honored. Previously silently dropped by `extra: "ignore"`.
- **Generated `pyproject.toml`** — Added connector package dependencies (`PyGithub`, `notion-client`, `atlassian-python-api`, `slack-sdk`, etc.) so generated projects install required SDKs.
- **`memory.py.j2` boolean rendering** — Switched `| tojson` to `| capitalize` so Jinja-emitted booleans render as Python `True`/`False` rather than JSON `true`/`false`.
- **CLI command/comment alignment** — Fixed inconsistent spacing in CLI help output so commands and comments line up.
- **Test patch target for `is_connected`** — Tests now patch `app.main.is_connected` (where it's used after `from … import is_connected`) rather than `app.context_graph_client.is_connected` (where it's defined). Generated `test_routes.py` mock fixture also sets dummy API keys (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) before importing `app.main`, since PydanticAI's `Agent(...)` validates the key at module import time. Added regression guard `test_test_file_mocks_is_connected` in `tests/test_generated_project.py` so accidental removal is caught in the fast unit suite.
- **options-intelligence fixture quality** — Rewrote fixture with consistent per-underlying scoping. Cross-underlying contamination eliminated (each Underlying now has scoped `OptionsContract`, `ExposureLevel`, `KeyLevel`). Strike scales realistic per underlying (SPX ~5800, SPY ~580, QQQ ~500, IWM ~212, AAPL ~230). Regime timestamps chronologically consistent with `FLIPPED_TO`/`PRECEDED_BY` edges. Document content references title entities. Decision-trace placeholders replaced with concrete values from fixture entities. Greeks normalized (delta `-1..1`, gamma `0..0.15`, proper put delta signs).

### Improvements
- **`make schema` target** — Added to the generated `Makefile`. Comments on `make seed` and `make import-and-seed` clarified.
- **Tests** — 12 new tests for GitHub linking (regex/GraphQL/dedupe/precedence). 89 new tests for body-import toggle and configurable limits. 54 additional renderer tests covering connector field renames, memory boolean rendering, config Settings fields, and the new Makefile target.

## v0.9.4 — GitHub Actions release workflow bugfixes (2026-04-17)

### Bug Fixes
- **Upgrade npm cli for trusted publishing** - project currently uses npm 20 but we need the latest npm cli in order to perform the trusted publishing OIDC workflow.

## v0.9.3 — GitHub Actions release workflow bugfixes (2026-04-17)

### Bug Fixes
- **Target npm-wrapper directory for node pkg** - previously workflow was looing for package.json in top-level directory, but it lives in npm-wrapper.

## v0.9.2 — Batch Seeding Performance (2026-04-15)

### Bug Fixes
- **Batch entity seeding with `UNWIND`** — `make seed` previously executed one MERGE query per entity. With large Claude Code imports (27k+ entities), this caused seeding to appear to hang. Entity, relationship, and document creation now use `UNWIND $batch` with batches of 500, reducing ~27,000 round-trips to ~55.
- **Batch ingestion in `import_data.py`** — The `--ingest` path in generated import scripts also uses `UNWIND` batching.

## v0.9.1 — Claude Code Connector Fixes & Docs (2026-04-15)

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix `make import` crash** — The scaffolded Claude Code connector crashed with `int(None)` when `max_sessions` was passed as `None` from `import_data.py`. All credential reads now use the `or` idiom for None-safety.
- **Fix missing Settings fields** — Added `claude_code_scope`, `claude_code_since`, `claude_code_max_sessions`, `claude_code_content_mode`, `claude_code_base_path` to the generated `config.py` Settings class so `.env` variables are honored (previously silently dropped by `extra: "ignore"`). Also added `google_client_id`, `google_client_secret`, `gws_folder_id` for the Google Workspace connector.
- **Fix dict vs attribute access** — All template connectors return `dict` from `fetch()`, but `import_data.py` used attribute access (`data.entities`). Changed to `data["entities"]` across the board.
- **Don't write empty `fixtures.json` on crash** — The import script now skips writing `fixtures.json` when no data was collected, instead of silently overwriting it with empty lists.
- **Fix `make test-connection`** — Combined two sequential `asyncio.run()` calls into one, fixing the "Event loop is closed" error that made it print both "successful" and "failed".

### Improvements
- **Expanded scaffolded connector** (268 → 457 lines) — The template connector now extracts 9 entity types (added GitBranch, Error, Decision, Preference, Alternative) with 14 relationship types (added ON_BRANCH, ENCOUNTERED_ERROR, MADE_DECISION, CHOSE, REJECTED, NEXT, PRECEDED_BY, USED_TOOL, EXPRESSES_PREFERENCE). Includes secret redaction, language detection from file extensions, file path validation, and `[rerun: bN]` suffix stripping.
- **Claude-Code-specific demo scenarios** — When `--connector claude-code` is active, the "Try these" prompts now show relevant questions ("What files have I modified?", "Show me decisions", "What are my coding preferences?") instead of generic software-engineering prompts about PRs and incidents.

### Documentation
- Fixed dark-mode announcement bar (was white on dark background)
- Added explicit `@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local` plugin configuration
- Marked `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as required for the chat agent in the Claude Code tutorial

## v0.9.0 — Claude Code Connector, Google Workspace & Security (2026-04-02)

### New Connectors
- **Claude Code connector** — Reads local session JSONL files from `~/.claude/projects/` with no authentication required. Parses user/assistant messages, tool_use/tool_result blocks, and progress entries. Extracts 7 entity types (Project, Session, Message, ToolCall, File, GitBranch, Error) with 10 relationship types. Includes heuristic **decision extraction** (user corrections, deliberation markers, error-resolution cycles, dependency changes) and **preference extraction** (explicit statements, package frequency). Secret redaction (API keys, tokens, passwords, connection strings) applied by default. 8 session intelligence agent tools injected via the renderer. 5 CLI flags (`--claude-code-scope`, `--claude-code-project`, `--claude-code-since`, `--claude-code-max-sessions`, `--claude-code-content`). Implementation split into `connectors/claude_code_connector.py` and `connectors/_claude_code/` subpackage (parser, redactor, decision_extractor, preference_extractor).
- **Google Workspace connector** — Imports from 6 Google APIs (Drive Files, Comments, Revisions, Activity, Calendar, Gmail) with OAuth2 authentication and dynamic scope building. Extracts **decision traces** from resolved comment threads in Google Docs (question, deliberation, resolution, participants). 10 decision-focused agent tools (`find_decisions`, `decision_context`, `who_decided`, `document_timeline`, `open_questions`, `meeting_decisions`, `knowledge_contributors`, `trace_decision_to_source`, `stale_documents`, `cross_reference`). Cross-connector linking detects Linear issue references in comment bodies, doc names, email subjects, and meeting descriptions. 9 CLI flags for scoping imports. Rate limiting (950 queries/100s with exponential backoff).

### Security
- **Replaced weak cryptographic hashing** — Switched from MD5/SHA1 to SHA-256 for content hashing in connectors (code scanning alerts #8 and #9).

### Bug Fixes
- **Session collision fix** — `Session.name` now uses `session_id` as the unique MERGE key to avoid cross-session collisions when importing Claude Code data.
- **Linear connector hardening** — Don't fail on blank Linear team key; improved robustness of Linear import with better error handling.

### Improvements
- Google Workspace connector template improvements and renderer integration
- Updated import_data.py template to handle new connectors
- **10 total SaaS connectors** (GitHub, Notion, Jira, Slack, Gmail, Google Calendar, Salesforce, Linear, Google Workspace, Claude Code)
- 955 passing tests (1,165 collected including slow/integration)

## v0.8.2 — Linear Connector (2026-04-02)

### New Features
- **Linear SaaS connector** — GraphQL-based connector with cursor-based pagination and rate limiting against `https://api.linear.app/graphql`. Maps 12 entity types (Issue, Project, Cycle, Team, Person, Label, WorkflowState, Comment, ProjectUpdate, ProjectMilestone, Initiative, Attachment) to the POLE+O entity model with 26 relationship types. Imports issue relations, threaded comments with resolution tracking, project updates with health status, milestones, initiatives, attachments, and Linear Docs. Issue history entries are transformed into decision traces capturing state transitions, assignment changes, and priority changes with actor attribution. Uses stdlib only (`urllib.request`).
- **Linear connector hardening** — Named constants, structured logging, URLError/JSONDecodeError/429 handling with retry, pagination safety limits (`MAX_PAGES`), null-safe field access, team key validation during `authenticate()`, incremental sync via `updated_after`.

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix traces silent failure** — Decision trace ingestion no longer silently fails on malformed data.

### Documentation
- New tutorial: `linear-context-graph.md` — end-to-end guide for importing Linear project data
- Updated CLI options reference and SaaS data import guide

## v0.8.1 — Schema Node Fix & Responsive Docs (2026-03-31)

### Bug Fixes
- **Click on schema node works again** — The `Button` component was added to the template for the "Ask about [entity]" feature but was never added to the `@chakra-ui/react` import. Clicking a schema node crashed the React component, preventing double-click expand from working.
- **Python 3.14 boundary** — Added `<3.14` to `requires-python` for forward compatibility.

### Improvements
- Improved responsive design for Docusaurus landing page

## v0.8.0 — Embedding Fix, Data Quality & Documentation (2026-03-28)

### Critical Fixes
- **neo4j-agent-memory no longer requires OpenAI API key** — Removed `[openai]` extra from the generated `pyproject.toml` dependency. Conversation memory now uses local `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384 dims) by default. If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in the environment, automatically upgrades to OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` (1536 dims). Added `sentence-transformers>=2.0` as an explicit dependency so local embeddings work out of the box with zero API keys.
- **openai-agents framework warns about missing API key** — CLI now displays a clear warning when `--framework openai-agents` is selected without `--openai-api-key`. The interactive wizard prompt text changes to indicate the key is "required" (not optional) for this framework.

### Data Quality
- **67 new entity name pools** — Added domain-appropriate names for every entity label across all 22 domains. `LABEL_NAMES` now has 118 entries (up from 51), eliminating all "Label 1" / "Label 2" fallback names. Covers agent-memory (Conversation, Memory, Session, ToolCall), digital-twin (Alert, Asset, Sensor, Reading, MaintenanceRecord, System), golf-sports (Round, Handicap, Hole, Course, Tournament), hospitality (Room, Reservation, Guest, Staff), oil-gas (Well, Equipment, Reservoir, Formation, Permit), personal-knowledge (JournalEntry, Note, Bookmark, Contact, Topic, Project), retail-ecommerce (Order, Product, Customer, Campaign, Category), vacation-industry (Booking, Package, Resort, Season), wildlife-management (Sighting, Camera, Habitat, Individual, Threat), conservation (Stakeholder), data-journalism (Correction), GIS (Boundary, Coordinate, Feature, Layer, MapProject, Survey), GenAI/LLM-Ops (Model, Prompt, Evaluation, Experiment), product-management (Epic, Metric, Objective, Release, Feedback, UserPersona), and scientific-research (Paper, Researcher, Grant, Institution).
- **Post-generation value clamping** — LLM-generated entities are now post-processed by `_validate_and_clamp()` in `generator.py`. Clamps 28 property types to domain-reasonable ranges (e.g., `price_per_night`: $30–$2,000; `duration_hours`: 0.25–24; `rating`: 1–5; `latitude`: -90–90). Also corrects taxonomy class mismatches (e.g., Bengal Tiger → "mammalia", not "aves").
- **Richer entity descriptions** — Added `_LOCATION_LABELS`, `_EVENT_LABELS`, and `_OBJECT_LABELS` sets (parallel to existing `_PERSON_LABELS`/`_ORGANIZATION_LABELS`) for POLE-type-aware descriptions. Added 7 label-specific description overrides for Medication, Permit, Sensor, Equipment, Paper, Model, and Species. Fallback descriptions no longer say "record tracked in the knowledge graph".
- **digital-twin fixture fix** — Fixed label casing in `digital-twin.json` (UPPERCASE → PascalCase) to match the domain YAML schema.
- **Domain-scoped entity MERGE keys** — Changed entity MERGE from `{name: $name}` to `{name: $name, domain: $domain}` in both `generate_data.py.j2` and `ingest.py`. Prevents constraint violation warnings when multiple domains share a single Neo4j instance.

### Framework Fixes
- **google-adk AttributeError guard** — Added `try/except AttributeError` around `runner.run_async()` in both `handle_message` and `handle_message_stream` to gracefully handle the `google-genai` SDK's `BaseApiClient` cleanup error when `_async_httpx_client` was never initialized.

### Documentation
- **Quick-Start page** — New `docs/quick-start.md` with a 5-step guide: scaffold → Neo4j setup → configure → seed → start.
- **use-neo4j-local guide** — New `docs/how-to/use-neo4j-local.md` covering `@johnymontana/neo4j-local` (npx), Neo4j Desktop, and Docker standalone with troubleshooting tips.
- **Domain catalog** — New `docs/reference/domain-catalog.md` listing all 22 domains with entity types, agent tool counts, sample questions, and scaffold commands. Auto-generated from domain YAML files.
- **Architecture diagram** — Mermaid flowchart added to the Introduction page showing CLI → Template Engine → Backend/Frontend → Neo4j data flow. Added `@docusaurus/theme-mermaid` for rendering.
- **switch-frameworks 404 fix** — Added `slug: switch-frameworks` to frontmatter so `/docs/how-to/switch-frameworks` resolves correctly.
- **Updated navigation** — Sidebar now includes quick-start, use-neo4j-local, and domain-catalog pages.

### Frontend UX
- **Larger status indicator** — Backend health dot enlarged from 8px to 12px with a text label ("Connected" / "Degraded" / "Offline").
- **Health check retry on initial load** — First page load now retries the health check 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) before showing "Offline". Prevents the transient "Internal Server Error" on initial Next.js compilation.
- **Improved empty graph state** — Empty knowledge graph panel now shows a link icon, "Your knowledge graph will appear here" heading, and actionable guidance text instead of a minimal "No graph data to display" message.

### Testing
- 691 passing tests (89 new), up from 602
- **New `tests/test_fixtures.py`** (88 tests) — Cross-validates all 22 domains:
  - Schema alignment: fixture entities have all required YAML properties
  - Agent tool property references: Cypher queries only reference properties that exist in schema or fixtures
  - Label coverage: fixtures include entities for every YAML-defined label
  - Data quality: numeric property values fall within reasonable ranges

## v0.7.0 — Documentation Site Redesign & CI (2026-03-28)

### New Features
- **Docusaurus landing page redesign** — New animated terminal hero section with domain-specific demo commands, improved hero animation timing, and terminal width/height fixes.
- **Mobile navigation** — Responsive nav bar with mobile layout improvements and design polish.
- **CI matrix job** — Full test suite (including domain × framework matrix, perf, and generated project tests) now runs in the `matrix` CI job on push to `main`.

- Updated sidebars with all new pages

### Bug Fixes & Data Quality
- Bug fixes and data quality improvements across domains
- Updated docs and test coverage

## v0.6.1 — Stability, Data Quality & Tool Coverage (2026-03-28)

### Critical Bug Fixes
- **CrewAI dependency fix** — Changed `crewai>=0.1` to `crewai[anthropic]>=0.1` in framework dependencies. The crewai agent template uses `llm="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"` which requires the anthropic extra. Without it, the generated project crashes on startup with `ImportError: Anthropic native provider not available`.
- **CLI non-interactive mode fix** — The CLI no longer requires a positional `PROJECT_NAME` argument when all flags (`--domain`, `--framework`) are provided. Auto-generates a slug like `healthcare-pydanticai-app`. Also added TTY detection with helpful error messages for CI/CD environments.

### Data Quality Improvements
- **Document Markdown rendering** — Static document content now uses Markdown headings (`##`) instead of RST-style `===`/`---` separators. The DocumentBrowser component renders content with ReactMarkdown.
- **Entity-derived document titles** — Document titles now reference primary entities: "Discharge Summary: Maria Elena Gonzalez" instead of generic "Discharge Summary #1".
- **Realistic entity descriptions** — Replaced generic "Comprehensive patient profile for..." with POLE-type-aware descriptions using domain roles and industries (e.g., "Dr. Sarah Chen, attending physician specializing in healthcare").
- **Domain-aware Organization.industry** — Added `DOMAIN_INDUSTRY_POOL` for all 22 domains. Healthcare organizations get "Hospital Systems" instead of "Technology".
- **Realistic decision trace observations** — Observations now reference actual entity names: "Verified Dr. Sarah Chen against healthcare standards" instead of generic "Found 7 relevant records".
- **Improved thinking text filter** — Added continuation patterns to catch multi-sentence agent thinking blocks between tool calls.

### New Agent Tools (All 22 Domains)
- **`list_*` tools** — Every domain now has a list tool for its primary entity type (e.g., `list_patients`, `list_players`, `list_accounts`) with sort and limit parameters.
- **`get_*_by_id` tools** — Every domain now has a direct ID lookup tool that returns the entity with all connections (e.g., `get_patient_by_id`, `get_player_by_id`).
- **Gaming-specific** — Added `get_top_players` tool (sort by level) for the gaming domain.

### Frontend Improvements
- **"Ask about this" button** — Clicking a node in the Knowledge Graph shows an "Ask about [entity]" button that sends a query to the chat.
- **Node hover tooltips** — Graph nodes show full name, labels, and key properties on hover.
- **Health polling optimization** — Reduced polling frequency from 30s to 60s.
- **Responsive hint text** — Keyboard shortcut hint hidden on small screens to prevent overlap.
- **Suggested question max width** — Pill buttons capped at 320px to prevent layout stretching.
- **Scrollable label badges** — Label filter badges in the graph panel scroll when they overflow.
- **Seed constraint fix** — Entity seeding now uses `ON CREATE SET / ON MATCH SET` to avoid constraint violations on re-seed.

### Documentation
- **4 new docs pages** — "Use Neo4j Aura", "Use Docker", "Why Context Graphs?", "Framework Comparison"
- **Updated sidebars** — All new pages added to Docusaurus navigation

### Testing
- 602 passing tests (57 new), up from 545

## v0.6.0 — Comprehensive Testing Feedback (2026-03-28)

### Framework Fixes
- **CrewAI no longer hangs** — Added explicit `llm="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"` to prevent defaulting to OpenAI. Added request-level logging and reduced timeout to 60s.
- **Strands serialization fix** — Added `_extract_text()` helper that robustly extracts text from agent results, handling `ParsedTextBlock` serialization issues from newer Anthropic SDK versions.
- **Google ADK API key support** — Added `--google-api-key` CLI flag (`GOOGLE_API_KEY` env), wizard prompt when google-adk is selected, and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in generated `.env`/`.env.example` templates.

### Document & Trace Ingestion Fix
- **`--ingest` now creates proper Document and DecisionTrace nodes** — Both ingestion paths now create `:Document` and `:DecisionTrace`/`:TraceStep` nodes using direct Cypher, matching the `generate_data.py` pattern that the frontend expects. Previously, Documents and Decision Traces panels appeared empty after `--ingest`.
- **Entity MERGE fix** — Direct driver ingestion now uses `MERGE (n:Label {name: $name}) SET ...` instead of `MERGE (n:Label {all_props})`, preventing duplicate nodes.

### Data Quality
- **Domain-aware base entities** — Person, Organization, Location, Event, and Object entities now use domain-specific names and roles (doctors for healthcare, traders for finance, game designers for gaming, etc.).
- **Fixed templated property values** — Properties like "Metformin 500mg - Contraindications" now replaced with realistic values. Added pools for contraindications, dosage_form, allergies, sector, lead_reporter, manufacturer, mechanism_of_action, population_trend, and habitat.

### Frontend UI Improvements
- **Redesigned chat input** — Bordered container with focus highlight and keyboard shortcut hint (Chakra UI Pro inspired).
- **Suggested questions redesign** — Pill-shaped buttons with full text (no 60-char truncation), "Try these" label with Sparkles icon.
- **Message avatars** — User and assistant messages now have Circle avatars with User/Bot icons.
- **Tool progress counter** — Shows "Running tool N of M..." during tool execution.

### CLI
- **`--demo` convenience flag** — Shortcut for `--reset-database --demo-data --ingest`
- **`--google-api-key` flag** — New CLI flag with `GOOGLE_API_KEY` env variable support

### Testing
- 545 passing tests (35 new), up from 510

## v0.5.3 — Agent Loop Breakout Fix (2026-03-27)

### Bug Fixes
- **Prevent agents from returning pre-tool text as the final answer** — PydanticAI's `run_stream` fires a `FinalResultEvent` the moment any `TextPart` begins streaming. When Claude emits "I'll search for..." alongside a tool call, `run_stream` treats that text as the final output and exits before tool results are incorporated. Replaced `agent.run_stream()` + `stream_text()` with `agent.run()` in `handle_message_stream`, which completes the full agent loop before emitting text.
- **Ruff lint fixes** — Resolved lint errors across connectors, tests, and scripts.
- **Test assertion fix** — Directory conflict test now asserts on "not empty" instead of "already exists" for better cross-platform compatibility.
